; Some documentation I found in a random github issue
;   @indent.begin       ; indent children when matching this node
;   @indent.end         ; marks the end of indented block
;   @indent.align       ; behaves like python aligned/hanging indent
;   @indent.dedent      ; dedent children when matching this node
;   @indent.branch      ; dedent itself when matching this node
;   @indent.ignore      ; do not indent in this node
;   @indent.auto        ; behaves like 'autoindent' buffer option
;   @indent.zero        ; sets this node at position 0 (no indent)

; NOTE: these don't work well with Allman style.
; Also; I am really bad at this. There is almost no documentation available and I don't speak lisp or whichever of it's flavors this is.

; Incomplete
